## Theme

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools are closed suddenly leaving Mrs. Ojha wondering how she is going to improve the Math skills of her mischievous son Ash Jr. who is presently in class 2 and refuses to study at home.

She tried hard to make him follow the online classes of his school teacher, but all her efforts were futile. Help Mrs. Ojha by designing an adaptive learning application that will help Ash Jr. to learn different topics in an engaging, playful, and interactive manner.



## Proposed Features 

### Basic :

1. Login/Signup facility for students with mail verification.
2. Reset password using SMS OTP or mail.
3. ChatBot based topic wise learning.
4. Interactive Teacherâ€™s Dashboard.

### Advanced :

1. Reward and Recognition System

    In order to make learning joyful for the students, a reward and recognition system can be made. The recognition system traces the time spent by the student on the portal and their consistency in solving problems to award them with virtual coins and badges. The coins can then be used to redeem certain benefits from teachers like extra computer time, free chocolates etc, and a leader board of students on the basis of coins and badges can also be prepared.

2. Discussion Forum

    A discussion forum can also be developed where the students can ask their questions and get it answered by any of their peers. The students who are able to solve the doubts of their peers are also rewarded with virtual coins. This will enhance peer to peer learning among students.
